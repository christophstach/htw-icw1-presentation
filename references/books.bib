    abstract="When we graph a function f (x) of a rational variable x, we make a leap of faith and assume that the function values f (x) vary ``smoothly'' or ``continuously'' between the sample points x, so that we can draw the graph of the function without lifting the pen. In particular, we assume that the function value f (x) does not make unknown sudden jumps for some values of x. We thus assume that the function value f (x) changes by a small amount if we change x by a small amount. A basic problem in Calculus is to measure how much the function values f (x) may change when x changes, that is, to measure the ``degree of continuity'' of a function. In this chapter, we approach this basic problem using the concept of Lipschitz continuity, which plays a basic role in the version of Calculus presented in this book.",
